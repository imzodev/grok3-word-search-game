Create a single-player   using React and Tailwindcss classes.
The game should allow the user to search for words hidden in a grid of letters.
The game should be interactive, visually appealing, and easy to play.

Requirements: 

Game Grid:
Create a grid of letters (e.g., 10x10 or customizable size).
The grid should contain a predefined list of words hidden horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The remaining spaces should be filled with random letters.

Word List:
Display a list of words the player needs to find.
Highlight found words in the list (e.g., strike through or change color).

User Interaction:
Allow the player to click and drag to select letters in the grid.
If the selected letters form a valid word from the list, highlight the word in the grid and mark it as found in the list.

Visual Feedback:
Highlight the selected letters in the grid while the player is dragging.
Provide visual feedback when a word is found (e.g., change the color of the letters or add a checkmark).

Win Condition:
Display a congratulatory message when all words are found.

Styling:
Use the library Tailwind CSS to make the game visually appealing.
Ensure the grid and word list are neatly displayed.


Optional Features:
Add a "New Game" button to generate a new word search grid.

Add a timer to track how long the player takes to find all the words.

Allow the player to choose the grid size or difficulty level.
